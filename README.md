# Sentiment-Classification
we will design a sentiment classifier for classifying the sentiment of the reviews. This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the input is a natural language text and output is the sentiment label. We will consider two different review datasets: yelp reviews for restaurants and IMDB reviews for movies.
